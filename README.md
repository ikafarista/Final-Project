# Final-Project

To understand the growth of psychologist workforce over the last decade, I explored the dataset of Studio/Race_Ethnicity_Trend_data.csv from https://www.apa.org/workforce/data-tools/demographics on Python (Final Project.ipynb). From the codes, I found out the percentage of the Asian American psychologist in the total workforce only grew 1% in a span of a decade. But in headcount, the number of Asian American psychologist grew 41% from 2855 in 2010 to 4887 in 2019. I than ran the results on Tableau and created the first visualization.

For the ratio of Asian American psychologist to the Asian American population, I created an excel (Mental Health Provider.xlsx) that compared the number of psychologist that I got from Python and number of population from the Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Age, Race Alone or in Combination, and Hispanic Origin for the United States: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019 (NC-EST2019-ASR5H) accessed through https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2020/population-estimates-detailed.html.
